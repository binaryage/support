## Tips for the Support Email
If you have specific problems with your installation, and the forum wasn't helpful, please do the following:

Go to Console in your Applications->Utilities folder.  In the upper-right-hand corner you'll see a search box; type in "TotalFinder" or the name of the product that's giving you trouble and include any lines that come up from this search in your email to us.

Then, email us at our [support email](mailto:support@binaryage.com).  We usually respond within 24 hours.
